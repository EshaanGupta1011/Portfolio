            <p>
              Photography has always been a cherished and comforting hobby for
              me. I donâ€™t usually roam around with my camera, but I make it a
              point to capture beautiful moments whenever the opportunity
              arises.
              <br />
              <br />
              My journey into photography began when my father gifted me a DSLR.
              I was a curious beginner and, in my excitement, set the aperture
              to its maximum, briefly panicking that I might have broken it. The
              relief and joy I felt upon realizing everything was fine marked
              the start of my passion for this art form.
              <br />
              <br />
              Over time, I honed my skills and achieved recognition as a
              photographer. I won intra-school photography competitions and even
              had the privilege of organizing and judging a few. I was also a
              core member of Darpan, the photography and videography society at
              USAR, where I took on the responsibility of covering various
              college events. This experience not only refined my craft but also
              deepened my appreciation for storytelling through visuals.
